Name
Bulleted

Description
Bulleted is an online bullet journal meant to make the flexibility and customization of bullet journals more accesible in your day to day life.


Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

Usage
You will presently be able to include a personal journal as well as daily, weekly and monthly todo lists

Roadmap
For future releases we are looking to make the site even more customizable. Adding in functionalities for trackers (i.e period tracker, habit tracker). Weather API access

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.
